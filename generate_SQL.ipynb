      "**Explanation and Justification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Efficiency and Scalability:**  All queries use aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX) which are highly optimized in BigQuery.  The `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` operations in the \"Most popular station\" query are also handled efficiently by BigQuery's distributed processing.  There are no subqueries or complex joins that would negatively impact performance.  Using `LIMIT 1` on the \"Most popular station\" query ensures that only the top result is returned, further improving efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Readability and Maintainability:** The queries are straightforward and use clear, descriptive aliases (e.g., `total_trips`, `average_trip_duration`).  Each query is separated by a comment, making it easy to understand the purpose of each section.  The table name is parameterized (`your_project.your_dataset.your_table`) to make it easy to adapt the query to different datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Correctness:** The queries directly address the requirements of the problem statement.  They use the appropriate columns and functions to calculate the desired results.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Data Types:** The queries assume that `tripduration` is a numeric type (INT64, FLOAT64, etc.) and that `starttime` and `stoptime` are TIMESTAMP or DATETIME types.  If the data types are different, you may need to cast them appropriately (e.g., `CAST(tripduration AS INT64)`).\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to Use:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Replace Placeholders:**  Replace `your_project.your_dataset.your_table` with the actual project ID, dataset name, and table name of your BigQuery table.\n",
      "2.  **Execute in BigQuery:**  Copy and paste each query into the BigQuery query editor and run them individually.  You can also run them all at once, but the results will be displayed separately.\n",

      " --  - **Partitioning:** If the `Orders` table is very large, consider partitioning it by date (e.g., monthly or yearly) to improve query performance.\n",
      " --  - **Query Execution Plan:**  Use the database's query execution plan tool to analyze the query and identify potential bottlenecks.  This will help you fine-tune the query and indexes for optimal performance.\n",
      " --  - **Statistics:**  Ensure that the database statistics are up-to-date.  This helps the query optimizer make better decisions about how to execute the query.\n",
      " --  - **Caching:**  Implement caching mechanisms to store the results of frequently executed queries.\n",
      " --  - **Avoid Functions in WHERE Clause:**  Avoid using functions like `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`, and `DAY()` directly in the `WHERE` clause if possible, as they can prevent the use of indexes.  Instead, try to rewrite the query to use date ranges.  The CTE example above demonstrates one way to avoid this.\n",
